% Chapter Abstract
% ----------------

\footnotesize
\begin{quote}\itshape In this chapter we discuss the meaning of \emph{Open
Source} and the common features of all Open Source Software. We scan historical
and con\-ceptual aspects. It's the chapter of background knowledge. At the end
you will know that software is only Open Source Software if you as customer gets the
right to use, to modify, and to redistribute the code without any limitations,
but with some obligations. And these obligations implicitly refer to different
historical contexts which might influence the understanding of your licenses.
