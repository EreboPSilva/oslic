\section{Open Source, OSI, and OSD}
\footnotesize
\begin{quote}\itshape
Here we describe the meaning of Open Source. At the end of this chapter you
should know that Open Source Software is defined by a set of necessary criteria
which together determine the common basic features of Open Source Licenses.
Additionally you will have understood that the opposite of Open Source Software
can not only by defined ex negativo. But you should also know that these features
can differently be implemented. Therefore the OSD can not be read as a set of
rules describing what we have to do if we want to fulfill the Open Source
Licenses. You should know that you have to go back to the license itself.
