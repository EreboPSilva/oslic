% Chapter Abstract
% ----------------

\footnotesize
\begin{quote}\itshape
This chapter offers the \emph{Open Source Use Case Finder}: Firstly, it presents
a form to gather the specifying information. Secondly it offers a tree, which
can easily be transversed by the gathered information. And finally it contains
the list of \emph{Open Source Use Cases}. Each leaf of the tree leads to one
\emph{Open Source Use Case} which itself then refers to the specific license
fulfilling to-do lists.
