\section{BSD Licensed Software \ldots}

\subsection{The BSD specific mini finder}

As an approved Open Source license, the BSD license exists in two
versions\footcite[Following the Open Source Initiative, initially a not approved
BSD license contained a fourth clause also known as advertising clause which
\glqq{}(\ldots) officially was rescinded by the Director of the Office of
Technology Licensing of the University of California on July 22nd, 1999\grqq{}.
 Cf.][\nopage wp. Because of the cancellation you can simply act according the
 \textit{BSD 3-Clause license} if you have to fulfill the eldest BSD
 license]{BsdLicense3Clause}. The latest, most modern release is the \textit{BSD
 2-Clause license}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{BsdLicense2Clause}, the elder
 release is the \textit{BSD 3-Clause license}\footcite[cf.][\nopage
 wp]{BsdLicense3Clause}. Nevertheless, the little differences between the
 two versions have to be respected.

All BSD Open Source Licenses explicitly focuses 'only' on the (re-)distribution
\textit{Open Source Use Cases}, which we have specified by our token
\textit{4others}. Conditions for the use cases specified by the token
\textit{4yourself} can be derived\footnote{For details of the \textit{Open
Source Use Cases tokens} see p. \pageref{OsucTokens}. For Details of the
\textit{Open Source Use Cases} based on these token see p.
\pageref{OsucDefinitionTree} }. Additionally the BSD license considers the form
of the distribution, e.g. whether the work is distributed as a (set of) source
code file(s) or as a (set of) the binary file(s). Use the following tree to find
the license fulfilling to-do lists\footcite[The BSD license requires, that a
re-distributed software package must contain the (package specific) copyright
notice, the (license specific) conditions and the BSD discaimer. (cf.][\nopage
wp.) You might ask what you should do, if these elements are missed in the
package you got. If so, the package you got had not been licensed adequately.
Hence, you do not know reliably whether you have received it under a BSD
license. In other words: If you have received a BSD licensed software package,
it must contain sufficient license fulfilling elements, or it is not a BSD
licensed software]{BsdLicense2Clause}.

you  distribute a program, an application, a server, a snippet, a module, a
library, or a plugin as an independent or an embedded unit} 

\item[covers] OSUC-02, OSUC-05, OSUC-07\footnote{For details see pp.

  the BSD license text, the specific copyright notice of the original author(s),
  and the BSD disclaimer - are retained in your package in the form you have got
  them.
  \item \textbf{[-b voluntary:]} Let the documentation of your distribution
  and/or your additional material also contain the original copyright notice, the
  BSD conditions, and the BSD disclaimer.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{BSD-3: Passing the unmodified software as a binary package}

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going distribute an unmodified version of the BSD
received software to 3rd. parties in form of a set of binary files or an

  BSD disclaimer according to the form of the source code package and insert
  these files into your distribution manually.

  \item \textbf{[-b voluntary:]} Let the documentation of your distribution
  and/or your additional material also contain the original copyright notice, the
  BSD conditions, and the BSD disclaimer.
  
  \item \textbf{[-c voluntary:]} It is a good practice of the Open Source
  community, to let the copyright notice which is shown by the running program
  also state that the program is licensed under the BSD license. Because you are
  already modifying the program, you can also add such a hint, if the presented
  original copyright notice lacks such a statement.

\subsubsection{BSD-6: Passing a modified library as independent source code
package}
\label{OSUC-08-BSD}
\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going distribute a modified version of the received
BSD code snippet, module, library, or plugin (snimoli) to 3rd. parties in form

BSD code snippet, module, library, or plugin (snimoli) to 3rd. parties in form
of a set of source code files or an integrated source code package together with
another larger software unit, which contains this code snippet, module, library,

  them.
  \item \textbf{[-b voluntary:]} Let the documentation of your distribution
  and/or your additional material also contain the original copyright notice, the
  BSD conditions, and the BSD disclaimer.
 \item \textbf{[-c voluntary:]} It is a good practice of the Open Source
  community, to let the copyright notice which is shown by the running program
  also state that it contains components licensed under the BSD license. Because
  you are embedding this snimoli into a larger software unit, you are
  developing this larger unit. Hence, you can also expand the copyright notice
  of this larger unit by such a hint to its BSD components.
\end{itemize}
\end{description}


\subsubsection{BSD-9: Passing a modified library as an embedded binary
package}

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going distribute a modified version of the received

  \item  \textbf{[+b mandatory:]} Ensure, that the documentation of your
  distribution and/or your additional material also contain the author specific
  copyright notice, the BSD conditions, and the BSD disclaimer.
 \item \textbf{[-c voluntary:]} It is a good practice of the Open Source

\subsection{Software licensed by the \emph{BSD 3-Clause License}}

Compared with the \textit{BSD 2-Clause license}, the \textit{BSD 3-Clause
license} only contains one additional 3rd. clause, the rest is the same. So, for
acting according the \textit{BSD 3-Clause license}, do that, what you would have
to do for fulfilling the 2 clause license. And additionally do not use the name
of licensing organization or the names of the licensing distributors to promote
your own work.
