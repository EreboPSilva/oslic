After all these introducing remarks let us summarize our idea: We know that the
right to use Open Source Software depends on doings required by the Open Source
Licenses. In opposite to the commercial licenses, you can not buy the right to
use a piece of Open Source software - never. It's part of the Open Source
Definition that the right to use the software may not be sold. The OSD
states firstly that an Open Source License may \glqq{}\ldots not
restrict any party from selling or giving away the software as a component of (any)
aggregate software distribution\grqq{}, and adds secondly that an Open Source
License \glqq{}\ldots shall not require a royalty or other fee for such
sale\grqq{}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp. ยง1]{OSI2012a}.

But it is not adequate to derive from this rule that you are automatically
allowed to use Open Source Software without any service in return: generally you
have to do something for getting the right to use the software. In other words:
Open Source Software is specified by the idea of 'paying by doing'.

Therefore these Open Source Licenses describe specific circumstances under
which the user must execute some tasks. These sets of conditions may be viewed
as triggers for a compliant behaviour. So, if we want to offer license fulfilling
to-do lists, we have to consider these triggers. 

The real challenge is, that such circumstances are not linear and simple. They
contain combinations of (sometimes) context sensitive conditions. These
conditions refer to different class of tokens. Such a class of token might
denote a feature of the software itself - like being an application or a library. Or
it might denote the circumstances of using the software -
like 'using the software only for yourself' or 'distributing the software also
to third parties'.

At the end, we want to determine a set of specific OSUCs - Open Source Use
Cases. And we want to deliver for each of these OSUCs and for each of the
considered Open Source Licenses one list of actions, which fulfill the license
in the context of this use case. In our discussion, such an \textit{Open Source
Use Case} shall be a set of tokens describing the circumstances of a specific
usage. So, in the beginning we have to specify the relevant classes of tokens.
Then we build the valid combinations of tokens, our Open Source Use Cases. And
finally - based on the specifying tokens - we generate a taxonomy. In the
next chapter this taxonomy will become the base of the Open Source Use Case
Finder which leads you to your specific OSUC by only a few questions and
answers. 

In other words: this chapter defines the relevant tokens and derives the
conceptual structures; the next chapter will use the results without depper
explanations. So, let's now start with the classes of tokens by which the
circumstances of using a piece of Open Source Software can be specified:

\begin{itemize}
  \item Firstly we will consider the \textbf{type of the Open Source Software}.
  We will distinguish between code snippets, modules, libraries or plugins on
  the one hand, and autonomous, processable applications, programs or servers on
  the other hand. Let's name the first set the 'snimolis' and the second the
  'proapses' for indicating, that we are not only talking about libraries and
  applications in the strict, sense. More detailedly spoken, we will ask you,
  whether the Open Source Software, you want to use, is a software library in
  the broadest sense (an includable code snippet, a linkable module or library,
  or a loadable plugin), or whether it is an autonomous application or server
  which can be executed or processed. In the first case, the answer should be
  'it's a snimoli', in the second 'it's a proapse'.
  \item Secondly we will consider the \textbf{state of the of the Open Source
  Software}: It might be used, as one has got it. Or one can modify it, before
  using it. More detailedly spoken, we will ask you, whether you want to leave
  the evaluated Open Source Software as you have got it, or whether you want to
  modify it before using and/or distributing it to 3rd parties. In the first
  case, the answer should be 'unmodified', in the second 'modified'.
  \item Thirdly we will consider the \textbf{usage context of the of the Open
  Source Software}: On the hand you might use the received Open Source Software
  as one of your readily constructed applications. On the other hand you might
  construct a larger application based upon the received Open Source, because it
  is using it as one of its' components. More detailedly spoken, we will ask
  you, whether you are you using the evaluated Open Source Software as an
  autonomous piece of software, or whether you are using it in combination
  with other components for setting up a larger, more complex piece software.
  \item Fourthly we will consider the \textbf{recipient of the of the Open
  Source Software}: Sometimes you might intend to use the received Open
  Source Software only for yourself, in other cases you might to intend to
  hand over the software also to other people. More detailedly spoken, we will
  ask you whether you are going to use the evaluated Open Source Software only
  for yourself or do you plan to (re)distribute it (also) to third parties?
  \item Fifthly and finally we will consider the \textbf{combining mode of the
  of the Open Source Software usage}: In this case, we will ask you, whether you
  are going to combine the evaluated Open Source Software with other
  software components by linking all together statically, by linking them
  dynamically, or by textually including the Open Source Software into your
  larger unit.
\end{itemize}

In the beginning we defined an Open Source Usecase as a set of classified
tokens. If we now simply combine all tokens of all classes with all tokens of
the other classes, we get 2*2*2*3*2 = 48 sets of tokens or 48 Open Source Use
Cases. But some of these sets are invalid from an empirical view. And some of
these sets are context sensitive:

Firstly, it offers no additional knowledge to ask you, whether you are going to
combine the received software with other software components by linking them
statically or dynamically, or by including it textually into a larger unit, if
you already have answered, that you want to use the received Open Source
Software in combination with other elements.

Secondly: If you already have specified that the used Open Source
Software is a \textit{proapse} - hence an autonomous program, an application,
or a server -, then your answer includes, that the software is used alone and is
not used in combination. But if you have specified that the used Open Source
Software is a \textit{snimoli} - hence a snippet of code, a module, a plugin, or a
librabry -, then it can indeed be used in combination (if it becomes a
component of a constructed larger unit) or be used alone (if it is
'only' re-distributed to 3rd parties).

And thirdly - just the other way round: If you already have specified that the
used Open Source Software is a \textit{snimoli} - hence a snippet of code, a
module, a plugin, or a library -, and that this \textit{snimoli} shall be used
only by yourself (not distributed to other 3rd. parties, then your answer
includes pratically, that this \textit{snimoli} is used in combination. This
is logical, because if you want to use it in the state \textit{alone}, then you
would have a software library on your disc (your are 'using' it for yourself)
without combining it to any other software: hence in this case this librabry
would lie on your disc and nothing more: a senseless use case.

Do you think this is complicate? Yes, so we do. We spent a couple of time to
explain ourselves these constraints. Only when we had transposed all
combinations and rules into a tree, we got the real insight into situation.
So let us summarize the these specifications by two little pictures before we
will specify the real Open Source Use Case finder:
