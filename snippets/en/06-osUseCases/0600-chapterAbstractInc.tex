% Chapter Abstract
% ----------------

\footnotesize
\begin{quote}\itshape
This chapter establishes our concept of \emph{Open Source Use Cases} as a
classification system for to-do lists. The conditions of a specific license, in
the context of a par\-ti\-cu\-lar \emph{Open Source Use Case}, will be fulfilled
by following the corresponding to-do list. Additionally this chapter introduces a
taxonomy for these \emph{Open Source Use Cases}. Later on, this taxonomy will
organize the \emph{Open Source Use Case Finder}.
