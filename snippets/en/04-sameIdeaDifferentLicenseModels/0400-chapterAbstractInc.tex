% Chapter Abstract
% ----------------

\footnotesize \begin{quote}\itshape In this chapter we describe different
license models which meet the common idea of being a piece of Free Open Source
Software. We want to discuss existing types of grouping licenses to underline
the limits of building such clusters: These groups are often used as 'virtual
prototypic licenses' which shall deliver a simplified view onto the conditions
how to act according to the referred real license instances. But one has to
fulfill the requirements of a specific license, not his generalized idea of a
set of licenses. Nevertheless, we wish to offer structuring view into the world
of the Open Source Licenses too. We will use a new set of grouping criteria by
referring to the common intended purpose of each license: each license wants to
protect something or someone against something or someone. Following this
pattern, we can indeed summarize the essence of each license in a comparable
way.
