\section{LGPL licensed software}

Both versions of the GNU Lesser General Public License explicitly distinguish
the distribution of the source code from that of the binaries: On the one hand,
the LGPL-2.1 mainly talks about copying and distributing the source
code\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §1, §2, §5, §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. But it
also directly mentions the specific conditions for \enquote{[\ldots] (copying)
and (distributing) the Library [\ldots] in object code or executable form
[\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §4]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. On the other
hand, also the LGPL-3.0 and the GPL-3.0 -- which have to be considered together
because the GPL-3.0 is included into the LGPL-3.0\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp, just
before §0]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a} -- are treating the distribution of source
code and the distribution of the object code as different aspects of the same
phenomenon\footnote{The GPL-3.0 contains a specific section named
\enquote{Conveying Non-Source Forms} which describes the conditions to
\enquote{[\ldots] convey a covered work in object code form [\ldots]}
(\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §6]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a})), while the LGPL-3.0
explicitly deals with the \enquote{object code incorporating material from (the)
library header files}(\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a})).}.
Additionally, LGPL-2.1 and LGPL-3.0 mainly talk about copying and distribution
the software; the private use is nearly complete unspecified\footnote{The
LGPL-2.1 lists its 'restrictions' only with respect to the act of copying and
distributing \enquote{copies of the library} (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §1, §2, §4
et passim]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}) while the GPL-3.0 explicitly specifies that
one \enquote{[\ldots] may make, run and propagate covered works that (one does)
not convey, without conditions so long as (the) license otherwise remains in
force} (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §2]{Gpl30OsiLicense2007a}).}. Finally, the
LGPL-2.1 and the LGPL-3.0 are aiming for the same results and the same spirit by
requiring nearly the same license fulfilling tasks. Therefore it is appropriate
to cover both versions in one chapter and to offer the same LGPL specific open
source use case structure\footnote{For details of the general OSUC finder

  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the licensing elements -- esp.\ the
  copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that refer to the
  license and to the disclaimer of warranties -- are retained in your package in
  the form you have received them. If you compile the binary from the sources,
  ensure that all the licensing elements are also incorporated into the package.
  
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Give the recipient a copy of the LGPL 1.1
  license. If it is not already present in the binary package, add
  it\footnote{For implementing the handover of files correctly $\rightarrow$
  OSLiC, p. \pageref{DistributingFilesHint}}.
 
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Create a \emph{modification text file}, if such a
  notice file still does not exist. \emph{Expand} the \emph{modification text
  file} by a description of your modifications.
  
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Make the source code of the embedded library and
  the source code of your overarching program accessible via a
  repository\footnote{Formally, the LGPL-1.1 is only a license with weak
  copyleft. But this is only a result of the allowance to relicense the software
  ($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\ \pageref{sec:ProtectingPowerOfEupl}). So, as long as
  you do not relicense the embedded library with respect to the list of
  \enquote{compatible licenses accodring to article 5 LGPL} (\cite[cf.][\nopage
  wp §5 and Appendix]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}), you also have to publish the code of
  your overarching work.}: Push the source code package into a repository and
  make it downloadable via the internet. Integrate an easily to find
  description into the distribution package which explains how the code can
  be received from where. Ensure, that this repository is online for as long as
  you continue to distribute the software.
  
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Execute the to-do list of use case LGPL-8\footnote{
  Making the code accessible via a repository means distributing the software in
  the form of source code. Hence, you must also fulfill all tasks of the
  corresponding use case.}.
  
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} License your overarching program also under the
  LGPL 1.1.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Mark all modifications of source code of the
  embedded library (snimoli) thoroughly -- namely within the source code and
  including the date of the modification.

  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Let the documentation of your distribution and/or
  your additional material  also reproduce the content of the existing
  \emph{copyright notice text files}, a hint to the name of the used LGPL
  licensed component, a link to its homepage, and a link to the LGPL 1.1 license
  -- especially as subsection of your own copyright notice.

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}
\subsection{\ldots concerning the LGPL-2.1}

\begin{itemize}
  
  \item The LGPL generally \enquote{[\ldots] does not grant permission to use
  the trade names, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor , except
  as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the origin of the
  Work and reproducing the content of the copyright
  notice}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §5]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. Therefore, the OSLiC
  genreally interdicts (LGPL-1 - LGPL-9) to promote any service or product --
  based on this software -- by such elements.

  \item The LGPL generally requires that \enquote{[\ldots] the Licensee shall
  keep intact all copyright, patent or trademarks notices and all notices that
  refer to the Licence and to the disclaimer of
  warranties}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §5]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. In a very strict
  reading, the LGPL does not limit this requirement to the distribution of the
  software. But practically, it will be impossible to control the compliant use
  of the software in those cases (\emph{4yourself}) without 'switching' into the
  use case 'distribution'. Therefore the OSLiC only inserts this requirement as
  a mandatory clause for the \emph{4others} use cases (LGPL-2 - LGPL-9).
  
  \item The LGPL also requires to \enquote{[\ldots] include [\ldots] a copy of
  the (LGPL) Licence with every (distributed) copy of the Work
  [\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §5]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. Therefore, all
  \emph{4others} use cases contain the respective mandatory condition (LGPL-2 -
  LGPL-9).
  
  \item Additionally, the LGPL requires, that the \enquote{licensee} who
  distribiutes a modified work \enquote{[\ldots] must cause any Derivative Work
  to carry prominent notices stating that the Work has been modified and the
  date of modification}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §5]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. Thus,
  the OSLiC integrates the mandatory requirement to generate (update) a
  respective notice file into all 'modification use cases and recommends to mark
  all modifications in the source code (LGPL-4 - LGPL-9)
  
  \item Furthermore, the LGPL requires that any distributor of the software
  \enquote{[\ldots] provide a machine-readable copy of the Source Code [\ldots]}
  by \enquote{[\ldots] (indicating) a repository where this Source will be
  easily and freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to
  distribute [\ldots] the Work}\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp\
  §5]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. To be precise, the LGPL also allows to directly
  distribute the source code together with the binary packages
  (\cite[cf.][\nopage wp\ §3]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}). With respect to the OSLiC
  principle to offer only one reliable way, the OSLiC simplifies this option:
  It 'only' asks for the repository solution.}. Therefore the OSLiC inserts a
  respective requirement into the task list of all cases concerning a binary
  distribution  (LGPL-3, LGPL-5, LGPL-7, LGPL-9)
  
  \item Finally, the LGPL contains a \enquote{copyleft clause} stating that if a
  \enquote{[\ldots] Licensee distributes [\ldots] copies of the Original Works
  or Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, this Distribution [...] will
  be done under the terms of this (LGPL) Licence [\ldots]}. In all the use cases
  which do not concern the use of an embedded component (LGPL-2 - LGPL-7) this
  copyleft clause is already fulfilled by either distributing the modified
  sources themselves of by making them accessible via a repository. In those
  cases where the licensee distributes an overarching program which uses an LGPL
  licensed component (LGPL-8 - LGPL-9) normally also the code of the overarching
  work must be distributed. Thus, with respect to the use case (LGPL-8) this is
  already fulfilled by definition. So, the OSLiC only mentions this default view
  in the case LGPL-9 and therefore implicitly evokes a strong copyleft effect of
  the LGPL\footnote{Formally, the LGPL-1.1 is a license with weak copyleft. But
  this is only a result of the allowance to relicense the software
  ($\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\ \pageref{sec:ProtectingPowerOfEupl}). So, as long as
  you do not relicense the embedded library with respect to the list of
  \enquote{compatible licenses according to article 5 LGPL}, you also have to
  publish the code of your overarching work. Therefore, you can only avoid this
  consequence by relicensing the embedded component by one of the compatible
  licenses with a weak copyleft listed in the LGPL appendix (\cite[cf.][\nopage
  wp §5 and Appendix]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a})}.
  

\end{itemize}
