\section{Microsoft Public License}


The MS-PL license is also one of the most permissive licenses. Thus, the
MS-PL specific finder can be simplified:

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute an unmodified version of the
received MS-PL software to 3rd parties -- in the form of binaries or as source

\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that all licensing elements -- esp.\ all
  copyright, patent, trademark, and attribution notices that are part of the
  version you received -- are completely retained in your package.
  
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Incorporate a complete copy of the MS-PL license
  into your package, regardless whether you distribute a source code or a binary
  package\footnote{$\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\ \pageref{MsplSourceBinHint}}.

  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Incorporate a complete copy of the MS-PL license
  into your package.
  
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} If you do not want to publish your modifications
  under the MS-PL too, then cleanly separate your own sources and licensing
  documents from original elements of the adopted work.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Mark your modifications in the sourcecode.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} It's a good tradition to let the documentation of
  your distribution and/or your additional material also contain a link to the
  original software (project) and its homepage (as far as this does not clashes
  with the prohibitions stated below).
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} You are allowed to expand an existing copyright
  notice of the program to mention your own contributions.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} It is a good practice of the open source
  community, to let the copyright notice which is shown by the running program
  also state that the program is licensed under the MS-PL license (as far as
  this does not clashes with the prohibitions stated below). Because you are
  already modifying the program, you can also add such a hint, if the 
  original copyright notice lacks such a statement.

  also state that the derivative work is based on a version originally licensed
  under the MS-PL license (as far as this does not clashes with the prohibitions
  stated below) -- perhaps by linking to the project homepage of the original.
  Because you are already modifying the program, you can also add such a hint,

\subsection{Discussions and Explanations}

The MS-PL is also a very permissive and short license. It requires to do:
(a) You must preserve existing licensing elements. (b) You must distribute
the source code as whole or \enquote{portions} of the source code under the
MS-PL. (c) You must add a copy of the license if you distribute (parts of) the
source code. (d) If you distribute a binary package, you must distribute (the
parts of) the work under a license \enquote{that complies with this (MS-PL)
license}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{MsplOsiLicense2013a}.

The most confusing clause is probably the condition, to \enquote{[\ldots]
distribute any portion of the software in compiled or object code form [\ldots]
only [\ldots] under a license that complies with this license}. But a closer
examination is lighting the situation: The only other conditions of the license
which refer to the context of distributing binaries are the requirements a) not
to abuse trademarks, b) not to bring a patent claim against any contributor, and
c) not to expect any warranties or guarantees with respect to the distributed
portion\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.\ §3A, §3B, §3E]{MsplOsiLicense2013a}.

Based on these readings we decided \ldots

\label{MsplSourceBinHint} 
\begin{itemize}
  \item \ldots to let you incorporate a copy of the license into your
  distribution even if it only contains the binaries of the unmodified version:
  if you have not modified it, you do not lose any advantage if you add the
  license, too. So, this is the best method to fulfill the \emph{MSL-PL binary
  condition}.
  \item \ldots to erase all mandatory conditions in case of the binary
  distributions: the patent restriction of the MS-PL itself is already covered
  by the MS-PL patent section of the OSLiC\footnote{$\rightarrow$ OSLiC, p.\
  \pageref{subsec:MsplPatentClause}} and the no warranty clause of the MS-PL by
  the OSLiC section concerning the power of the MS-PL\footnote{$\rightarrow$
  OSLiC, p.\ \pageref{sec:ProtectingPowerOfMspl}} while the trademark
  restrictions are explicitly added into the prohibition section.
  \item \ldots to erase the hints to a voluntarily updated copyright dialog in
  case of distributing a snimoli independently because the copyright dialog
  normally is designed by the overarching work which uses the library, not by
  the library itself.
\end{itemize}
