\section{EUPL licensed software}

Explictly, the European Union Public License does not distinguish the
distribution of the source code from that of the binaries on a finely graduated
level: first and foremost, the \enquote{Obligations of the Licensee} refer to
both forms\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en}. Implicitly, there
nevertheless arises an important difference by the requirement that a
\enquote{Licensee}, while he \enquote{[\ldots] (distributes) copies of the Work
[\ldots]} -- which must be read as the \enquote{Original Work and/or its
Derivative Work} -- has to \enquote{[\ldots] provide a machine-readable copy of
the Source Code or indicate a repository where this Source (is) easily and
freely available for as long as the Licensee continues to distribute [\ldots]
the Work}\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp\ ยง5]{EuplLicense2007en} The term
\enquote{Work} is resolved if ยง1.}: This requirement is of course already
fulfilled in the moment the licensee distributes the source code. Thus, for
getting simply processable task list, the following EUPL specific open source
use case structure\footnote{For details of the general OSUC finder $\rightarrow$

\label{OSUC-06-EUPL} \label{OSUC-09-EUPL}

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to use a received EUPL licensed software only
for yourself and that you do not hand it over to any 3rd party in any sense.
\item[covers] OSUC-01, OSUC-03, OSUC-06, and OSUC-09\footnote{For details 
$\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\ \pageref{OSUC-01-DEF} - \pageref{OSUC-09-DEF}}
\item[requires] no tasks in order to fulfill the conditions of the EUPL 2.0
license with respect to this use case:
  \begin{itemize}
    \item You are allowed to use any kind of EUPL software in any sense and in
    any context without any obligations as long as you do not give the software
    to 3rd parties.
  \end{itemize}

\subsection{EUPL-2: Passing the unmodified software as source code}
\label{OSUC-02-EUPL} \label{OSUC-05-EUPL} \label{OSUC-07-EUPL} 

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute an unmodified version of the
received EUPL software to 3rd parties in the form of a set of source code files or
an integrated source code package\footnote{In this case it doesn't matter
whether you  distribute a program, an application, a server, a snippet, a
module, a library, or a plugin as an independent or an embedded unit}

\item[covers] OSUC-02, OSUC-05, OSUC-07\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\ 
\pageref{OSUC-02-DEF} - \pageref{OSUC-07-DEF}}

\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Give the recipient a copy of the EUPL 2.0
  license. If it is not already present in the software package, add
  it\footnote{For implementing the handover of files correctly $\rightarrow$
  OSLiC, p. \pageref{DistributingFilesHint}}.
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the licensing elements -- esp.\ the
  specific copyright notice of the original author(s) -- are retained in your
  package in the form you have received them.
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that a \emph{notice text file}\footnote{
  The EUPL license seems purposely to be a bit ambiguous: it uses the term
  \enquote{``Notice'' text file}. In its strict sense, the term refers to a file
  named 'NOTICE.[txt\textbar{}pdf\textbar{}\ldots]'. In a weaker sense, it may
  denote any (text) file containing (licensing) notices. For being sure to act
  according to this requirement you should also read this term in the broader
  sense if there is no text file named 'NOTICE'} is retained in your package in
  the form you have received it.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Let the documentation of your distribution and/or
  your additional material also reproduce the content of the \emph{notice text
  file}, a hint to the software name, a link to its homepage, and a link to the
  EUPL 2.0 license.

the software constitutes patent infringement.

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute an unmodified version of the
received EUPL software to 3rd parties in the form of a set of binary files or an
integrated bi\-na\-ry package\footnote{In this case it doesn't matter
whether you  distribute a program, an application, a server, a snippet, a
module, a library, or a plugin as an independent or an embedded unit}

\item[covers] OSUC-02, OSUC-05, OSUC-07\footnote{For details $\rightarrow$ OSLiC, pp.\
\pageref{OSUC-02-DEF} - \pageref{OSUC-07-DEF}}

\item[requires] the following tasks in order to fulfill the license conditions:
\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Give the recipient a copy of the EUPL 2.0
  license. If it is not already present in the binary package, add
  it\footnote{For implementing the handover of files correctly $\rightarrow$
  OSLiC, p. \pageref{DistributingFilesHint}}.
  
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the licensing elements -- esp.\ the
  specific copyright notice of the original author(s) -- are retained in your
  package in the form you have received them. If you compile the binary from the
  sources, ensure that all the licensing elements are also incorporated into the
  package.
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the \emph{notice text file} is
  retained or integrated into your binary package in the form you have initially
  received
  it.
  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the \emph{notice text file} is also
  reproduced if and whereever such third-party notices normally appear --
  especially, if you are distributing an unmodified EUPL licensed library as
  embedded component of your own work which displays its own copyright notice.
  
  \item \textbf{[voluntary:]} Let the documentation of your distribution and/or
  your additional material also reproduce the content of the \emph{notice text

  all the information of that \emph{notice text file} you have received.

  \item \textbf{[mandatory:]} Ensure that the \emph{notice text file} is also

  program already displays a copyright dialog, update it in an appropriate
  manner.

  modifications thoroughly. Generate a \emph{notice text file}, if it still does not
  exist. Add (sic!) a description of your modifications into the \emph{notice text file}.

\subsection{EUPL-8: Passing a modified library as embedded source code}
\label{OSUC-10-EUPL}

\begin{description}
\item[means] that you are going to distribute a modified version of the received
EUPL licensed code snippet, module, library, or plugin (snimoli) to 3rd
parties in the form of a set of source code files or an integrated source code
package together with another larger software unit which contains this code

  integrated EUPL license and the \emph{notice text file} clearly refer only

\begin{itemize}
  \item The EUPL explicitly \enquote{[\ldots] does not grant permission to use
  the trade na\-mes, trademarks, service marks, or names of the Licensor
  [\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp\ ยง5, Section \enquote{Legal
