\section{Excursion: What is a 'Derivative Work' - the basic idea of open source [tbd]}
\footnotesize
\begin{quote}\itshape
We will shortly discuss existing attempts to define the derivated works of
technical aspects, like dynamical or statical linking or not. We will
prove that linking can not deliver a definite criteria: 1) modules are only
unzipped libraries. 2) you can distribute software as modules added by a script,
which statically(sic!) links all modules before executing the program. 3) The
criteria of pipe-communication is good, but not sufficient. 4) All these
attempts do not match the constituting features of script languages. Therefore we
will follow Moglen(?) and will argue from the viewpoint of a developer: it is
only a question of a function, method or anything else which calls (jumps into)
a piece of code which has been licensed by a license protecting
on-top-developments and you have a derivated work.
