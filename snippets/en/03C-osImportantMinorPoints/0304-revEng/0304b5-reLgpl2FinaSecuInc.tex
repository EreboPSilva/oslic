So far, we have done a lot of work: At first, we unfolded and dissolved some
stylisch condensed formulations of the original LGPL2-RevEng-Sentence by their
linguistically explicit version. At second, we explicated the logical structure
of the sentence. At third, we empirically carved out the real meaning of the
sentence. And finally we mapped the triggering part of that rule to some
verifiable facts. Indeed, a lot of work for understanding one sentence
correctly\footnote{Here, some readers might ask why the original authors have
encapsulated their clear ideas in such a sophisticate sentence. Here are two
answers: First, this question is practically irrelevant: The authors of the
LGPL-v2 did, what they have done. And many developers have already licensed
their works under the terms of the LGPL-v2. Thus, we simply have to live with
the results -- just until the last software being published under the terms of
the LGPL-v2 is relicensed by a better version. Probably this won't happen during
our life time. Secondly, we appreciate the foresight of the LGPL-v2 authors.
They wrote a license which have successfully worked for more than twenty years.
They chosed a formulation which had also to cover 'uninvented' techniques. So,
it is not so surprizing, that we -- today -- have to do a lot of work to
understand all details the original authors want to be understood.}. So, it is a
good securing to verify that the derived result fits the spirit and the goals of
the LGPL-v2 perfectly:

The LGPL-v2 clearly describes its goals. It wants to enable the community to let
an LGPL Library \enquote{[\ldots] become a de-facto standard}. And the LGPL
knows, that \enquote{to achieve this [goal], non-free programs must be allowed
to use the library}, because the \enquote{[\ldots] permission to use a particular
library in non-free programs enables a greater number of people to use a large
body of free software}. But the LGPL also asserts in this context, that
\enquote{although the Lesser General Public License is Less protective of the
users' freedom, it does ensure that the user of a program that is linked with
the Library has the freedom and the wherewithal to run that program using a
modified version of the Library}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp., preamble, emphasis
KR.]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}.

So -- as a last check of our derivation -- we can analyze, whether our derived
result violates this goal. If it does, then we probably made a tremendous fault;
if not, then we are allowed to trust in the consistence our analysis:

If you receive a work using the Library in form of a discret (set of)
dynamically linkable or combinable file(s) and if -- hence -- your provider
assumed that the delivered files are linked on your target machine which --
therefore -- has also to deliver the necessary dynamically linkable Libraries,
than you have the freedom systematically to replace the dynamically linked
Libraries by updated versions\footnote{In GNU/Linux -- for example -- you must
(only) copy the dynamically linkable new version of the Library into the
lib/-directory and replace the existing link by a version pointing to the newer
version. Sometimes you should additionally verify the ld.so.conf files and call
ldconfig tool.}. And as long as the newer versions of the Libraries preserve the
defined and declared interfaces, you can do that successfully.That's, what the
LGPL-v2 want to ensure.

In all other cases, you must have the permission of reverse engineering or you
have a direct access to the source code. So, you can use the corresponding tools
and techniques to replace the embedded version of the Library by a newer
version; especially if you have received a statically linked package. Hence,
also the second part of our interpretation respects the spirit of the LGPL-v2.

So, finally we can say, everything is fine: The LGPL2-RevEng-Rule -- together
with the meaning of being a portion of a Library -- does not only verifiably
exeplicate the meaning of the LGPL2-RevEng-Sentence, but also fits the spirit
and the purpose of the LGPL-v2 as it has been announced by its preamble.
