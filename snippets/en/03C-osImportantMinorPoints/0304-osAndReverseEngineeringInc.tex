\section{Excursion: Reverse Engineering and Open Source}

Beyond any doubt, the LGPL mentions \enquote{reverse engineering}
literally\footnote{For the LGPL-v2 \cite[cf.][\nopage wp.
§6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}; for the LGPL-v3 \cite[cf.][\nopage wp.
§4]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a} } for indicating that reverse engineering in any
sense must be allowed to use and distribute LGPL software compliantly:

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{\enquote{[\ldots] you may [\ldots] distribute a work
(containing portions of the Library) under terms of your choice, provided that
the terms permit [\ldots] \emph{reverse engineering} [\ldots]}
\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp, §6]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. The LGPL-v2 uses
the capitalized word \enquote{Library} for denoting a library which
\enquote{[\ldots] has been distributed under (the) terms} of the LGPL-v2.
(\cite[cf.][\nopage wp, §0]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}). Inside of our LGPL
chapter(s) we follow this interpretation. } }
\end{quote}

There are three strategies for dealing with such provisions. One can try to
fully honor its meaning, one can mitigate its meaning, or one can avoid to
discuss this requirement altogether:

A first group of well known open source experts take the sentence of the LGPL-v2
as a strict rule which requires that one has to allow reverse engineering of the
whole software product if one embeds any LGPL licensed component into that
product\footnote{For example, a very trustworthy German expert states that the
LGPL-2.1 generally requires that a distributor of a program which accesses a
LGPL-2.1 licensed library, must grant his customer also the right to modify the
accessing program and hence also the right to execute reverse engineering.
Literally the German text says:
\begin{quote}\enquote{Ziffer 6 LGPLv2.1 knüpft die Erlaubnis, das zugreifende
Programm unter beliebigen Lizenzbestimmungen verbreiten zu drüfen, an eine Reihe
von Verpflichtungen, die in der Praxis oft übersehen werden: Zunächst muss dem
Kunden, dem die Software geliefert wird, die Veränderung des zugreifenden
Programms gestattet werden und zu diesem Zweck auch ein Reverse Engineering zur
Fehlerbehebung. Dies dürfte alle Formen des Debugging und das Dekompilieren des
zugreifenden Programms umfassen.} (\cite[cf.][81]{JaeMet2011a}).\end{quote}
At first glance, also \enquote{copyleft.org} -- the \enquote{[...] collaborative
project to create and disseminate useful information, tutorial material, and new
policy ideas regarding all forms of copyleft licensing} (\cite[cf.][\nopage
wp.]{CopyLeftOrg2014a}) -- could be taken as another witness for such an
attitude of strict reading: Some of its contributors elucidate in a chapter
dealing with \enquote{special topics in compliance} that \enquote{the license of
the whole work must [sic!] permit \enquote{reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications} to the library} and that one therefore \enquote{ should take
care that the EULA used for the Application does not contradict this
permission}(\cite[cf.][86]{KuhSebGin2014a}}.

A second group of well known and knowledgeable open source experts signify that
the LGPL-v2 indeed literally contains a strict rule, but that this rule actually
is not meant as it sounds: For example, two of these explain that \enquote{these
requirements on the licensed combination require that the license chosen not
prohibit the customer’s modification and reverse engineering for debugging these
modifications in the work as a whole}. But then they directly add the
limitation, that \enquote{in practice, enforcement history suggests, it means
that the license terms chosen may not prohibit modification and reverse
engineering for debugging of modification in the LGPL’d code included in the
combination}\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp., chapter LGPLv2.1, section
6]{MogCho2014a}. Such a mitigation can also be found in the tutorial of
copyleft.org: After they have summarized the LGPL-v2 sentence as a strict rule,
they directly continue, that one \enquote{[\ldots] must refrain from license
terms on works based on the licensed work that prohibit replacement of the
licensed components of the larger non-LGPL'd work, or prohibit decompilation or
reverse engineering in order to enhance or fix bugs in the LGPL'd components}
(\cite[cf.][86]{KuhSebGin2014a}). This added specification indicates, that one
only has to facilitate the modification of the library and that reverse
engineering can be ignored as long as there are other ways to improve the
embedded library.}.

Finally, a third group of experts prefers not to discuss the problem of reverse
engineering, although this technique is literally mentioned in the license and
although they want explain how to use GPL/LGPL licensed software
complaintly\footnote{An article of Terry J. Ilardi might be taken as a first
witness of this third strategy: he profoundly explains the essence of the LGPL,
he especially discusses §6, and he delivers applicable rules like \enquote{DO
NOT statically link to LGPL [\ldots] code if you wish to keep your program
proprietary}. But he does not discuss \emph{reverse engineering}
(\cite[cf.][5f]{Ilardi2010a}). Similarily argues Rosen
(\cite[cf.][121ff]{Rosen2005a}). And -- despite their comments on reverse
engineering in the specific chapter \emph{special topics in compliance} -- the
copyleft.org document can also be taken as an instance of this attitude:
Although its' authors recommend to \enquote{study chapter 10 carefully} for
establishing an adequate \enquote{compliance with LGPLv2.1}
(\cite[cf.][86]{KuhSebGin2014a}), this chapter 10 -- dedicated to the meaning of
the \enquote{Lesser GPL} -- does not deal with reverse engineering, although it
discusses the §6 of the LGPLv2.1 in depth (\cite[cf.][56ff, esp.
60f]{KuhSebGin2014a}).}.

This situation must bother companies and people who want to use open source
software compliantly and who therefore are looking for guidance. Particularly it
disturbs those who want to protect their business relevant software. At the end,
they might consider that this sentence is not consistently understood by the
open source community itself. And -- as far as we know -- at least some of these
companies preventively prohibit their developers to embed LGPL licensed
components into programs which contain business relevant techniques.
Unfortunately, this consequence does not only obstruct access to a large set of
well written free software, but it scarcely possible to obey such an
interdiction consequently: The glibc, which enables the programms to talk with
the kernel of the GNU/Linux system\footnote{cf.
http://www.gnu.org/software/libc/}, is licensed under the LGPL\footnote{cf.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GNU\_C\_Library}. And hence, this library is
indirectly linked to or combined with any program running on the GNU/Linux
system. So, if the LGPL-v2 indeed required, that reverse engineering of every
program must be allowed, which contains any LGPL license library, then every
GNU/Linux user would be allowed to examine every GNU/Linux progam by
\emph{reverse engineering}, simply, because finally every GNU/Linux program is
linked to the glibc\footnote{This conclusion might surprise. But it is inferred
with exactly the same arguments as the conclusion, that without a licence
offering a weaker copyleft every program would have been licensed under the GPL.
The copyleft.org document explains this argumentation in great detail
(\cite[cf.][56f]{KuhSebGin2014a}).}. In other words: if the LGPL indeed required
the permission of reverse engineering, then every GNU/Linux program may be
reverse engineered.

But an exhaustive reading of the LGPL-v2 delivers a strong indicator for
another, more 'liquid' understanding of the LGPL: The preamble explains the
reason for offering another weaker license beside the GPL. It says that
\enquote{[\ldots] on rare occasions, there may be a special need to encourage
the widest possible use of a certain library, so that it becomes a de-facto
standard} and that therefore it could be strategicly necessary to \enquote{allow
[\ldots] non-free programs [\ldots] to use the library} without enforcing that
these programs become free software too\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp,
§preamble]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}.

So, if the LGPL had indeed determined that every program linked or combined to
any LGPL library may be reverse engineered, then the LGPL would have an effect
contrary to its own intention. It would have introduced something like security
by obscurity: First, the LGPL allows to protect the internals of your own work
against investigation because the code of the non-free programm using the
library does not necessarily have to be published as well\footnote{The weak
copyleft has been introduced for encouring the widest possible use of the
library}. But in the end the user would also be allowed to reverse engineer the
received binary -- and hence would nevertheless be able discover all
internals\footnote{It would only cost a little more effort - as security by
obscurity indicates.} By this means, the LGPL-v2 would have undermined its' own
raison d'$\grave{e}$tre introduced by its' inventors: under such circumstances
there probably would have been less hope that any LGPL library could have become
a defacto standard.

We know that the inventors of the GNU licenses and GNU software are very
sophisticated experts. They never would have published such an inconsistent
document. So, this dissent read in(to) the document is a strong indicator that
there must be a better way to understand the license. And thus, it is up to us,
the followers, to explicate a more adequate interpretation. Of course, such an
interpretation must be grounded on the written text. We, the scholars, must read
the license very strictly. We have to deduce 'understandings' only by matching
the interpretations explicitly, strictly, and reasonably back to the license
text itself.

Encouraged by the indication that a better understanding of the license may
exist and contrary to the other strategies, we are going to prove that, in
fact, none of the open source licenses\footnote{being discussed in the OSLiC} in
general require to allow reverse engineering of software containing a component
licensed under that open source license. In particular, we will prove, that even
the LGPL does not claim this permission generally: We want to explain, why the
LGPL only requires to permit reverse engineering if and only if the LGPL
licensed component is embedded into a statically linked and distributed piece of
software. Moreover, we want to show that in all other cases the LGPL allows 
to distribute packages without granting permission to reverse engineer the
software which uses the LGPL licensed library\footnote{By the way, our analysis
should also provide proof that the LGPL is not something like a 'poisoned'
license containing \enquote{an imprenetrable maze of technology babble} which
\enquote{[\ldots] should not be in a general-purpose software license}
(\cite[cf.][124]{Rosen2005a}). The challenge of the today's descendants is to
understand the former inventors of the GNU licenses and their way to think about
computing - including all the hassle the computing language C might provoke.}.
We hope that our analysis, grounded on the license text itself, will support
companies and people to compliantly use open source software more often and with
less scruples.

Hence, let us prove our position 'bottom up'. Let us firstly show that it is
true for the LGPL-v2 -- by explicating the license text lingually, then
logically, and finally empirically, before we infer the correct understanding.
Then let us show that it is also true for the LGPL-v3. And in the end let us
show that it is true for all other licenses, analysed by the OSLiC.

\subsection{Reverse Engineering in the LGPL-v2}
The LGPL-v2.1 contains one sentence which literally refers to the issues of 
\emph{reverse engineering}:

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{\enquote{[\ldots] you may [\ldots] combine or link a
\enquote{work that uses the Library} with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library, and distribute that work under terms of your
choice, provided that the terms permit modification of the work for the
customer's own use and \emph{reverse engineering} for debugging such
modifications.}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Linguistical Clarification}

For fulfilling our rule, to read the text strictly and deduce our
interpretations reasonably, let us firstly only highlight the syntactical
conjunctions for simplifying the understanding:

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{\enquote{[\ldots] you may [\ldots] combine
\textbf{or} link a \enquote{work that uses the Library} with the Library to
produce a work containing portions of the Library \textbf{and} distribute that
work under terms of your choice, \textbf{provided that} the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use \textbf{and} \emph{reverse
engineering} for debugging such modifications.}\footnote{\cite[cf.][\nopage wp.
emphasis KR.]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}. This first ellipse, notated by the string
'[\ldots]' refers to the phrase \enquote{As an exception to the Sections
above,}, the second to the phrase \enquote{also}. These words want to indicate,
that the LGPL offers its §6-way-of-distribion as an exception of its default
way. The kind of way is not affected by this hint. Thus, we feel free to
erase this contextual link. } }
\end{quote}

It is evident that the conjunction \emph{'provided that'} is splitting the
sentence into two parts: you are allowed to do something \emph{provided that} a
precondition is fulfilled. Additionally, both parts of the sentence --
the one before the conjunction \emph{'provided that'} and the part after it --
are syntactically condensed embedded phrases which also contain subordinated 
conjunctions and elliptical constructions\footnote{cf.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis\_\%28linguistics\%29, wp.
}. These syntactical interconnections must be disbanded:

Let us firstly dissolve the syntactical compression before the conjunction
\emph{'provided that'}: It is established by using the two other conjunctions
\emph{and} and \emph{or} and introduced by the subordinating phrase \emph{you
may [\ldots]}. Unfortunately, from a formal point of view, one can read the
phrase \emph{you may (X or Y and Z)} as two different groupings: either as \emph{you
may ((X or Y) and Z)} or as \emph{you may (X or (Y and Z))}.

But, fortunately, we know from the semantic point of view that speaking about
\emph{\enquote{[\ldots] combining \textbf{or} linking [\ldots something] to
produce a work containing portions of the Library}} denotes two different
methods which both can \emph{join} the components \emph{\enquote{[\ldots] to
produce a work containing portions of the Library}}. So, let us -- only for a
moment\footnote{Later on we will re-insert th original phrase!} -- simply
replace the string \emph{\enquote{combine or link}} by the string
\emph{\enquote{*join}}\footnote{When the LGPL and the GPL were initially
defined, the C programming language was the predominant model of software
development. Knowing this method eases the understanding of these licenses.
Thus, it is not totally wrong to take this token *join also as a curtsey to the
C programming language.}. This reduces the syntactical structure of the sentence
back to the simple phrase \emph{you may (W and Z)} in which \emph{W} stands for
\emph{(X or Y)}.

Now, we see also that the phrase \emph{you may (W and Z)} itself is a
condensed version of the explicit phrase \emph{ (you may W) and (you may Z)}.

Finally we have to note, that the phrase before the conjunction \emph{'provided
that'} contains also a linguistic ellipsis\footnote{cf.
http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ellipsis\_\%28linguistics\%29, wp.
}: It says that you may *join the components \enquote{to produce \textbf{a work
containing portions of the Library} \textbf{and} distribute \textbf{that work}
under terms of your choice}. With respect to the English grammar, we may
conclude that the second term \emph{that work} refers back to the previously
introduced specification of \emph{a work containing portions of the Library}: if
a complete phrase has just been introduced explicitly, then the English language
allows to reduce its' next occurence syntactically while its' complete meaning
is retained. Hence, conversely, we are allowed to unfold the reduced form to
restore the complete phrase.

So -- overall -- we may understand the phrase before the conjunction
\emph{'provided that'} as a phrase with the structure \emph{(you may W) and (you
may Z')}:

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{\textbf{((}you may [\ldots] \emph{*join} a
\enquote{work that uses the Library} with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library\textbf{) and (}you may [\ldots] distribute
that work containing portions of the Library under terms of your
choice\textbf{))}} \textbf{provided that} [\ldots]\end{quote}

Theoretically, a reader of the OSLiC could reject our first dissolution of the
LGPL-v2-§6-sentence. But for reasonably denying our interpretation he has to
deliver other resolutions of the lingustic elliptical subphrases or other
dissolvations of the conjunctions. Fortunately, it seems to be evident that such
attempts must violate the English grammar.

Let us now dissolve the part after the conjunction \emph{'provided that'}:
With respect to the \emph{'and'}, the subphrase \emph{the terms permit}
syntactically refer to both, the \emph{modifcation} and the \emph{reverse
engineering}: An embedded conjunction \emph{'and'} allows to use a more stylish
grammatical compaction. So, it should be clear, that saying

\begin{quote}\noindent\textbf{provided that} \emph{the terms permit modification
of the work for the customer's own use \emph{\textbf{and}} reverse engineering
for debugging such modifications}\end{quote}

means

\begin{quote}\noindent\textbf{provided that} \emph{the terms permit
\textbf{(} modification of the work for the customer's own use \emph{\textbf{and}}
reverse engineering for debugging such modifications\textbf{)}}\end{quote}

and is totally equivalent to the sentence 

\begin{quote}\noindent[\ldots] \textbf{provided that} \emph{\textbf{((}the terms
permit modification of the work for the customer's own use\textbf{)}
\emph{\textbf{and}} \textbf{(}the terms permit reverse engineering for debugging
such modifications\textbf{))}}.
\end{quote}

We believe that there is no other possibility to understand this sentence with
respect to the rules of the English language. Nevertheless, this is the next
point where an OSLiC reader may formally disagree with us. But if he really
wants to object our dissolution, he must deliver another valid interpreation of
the scope of the conjunction \emph{and} or he must deliver another resolutions
of the linguistic ellipsis. But we reckon, that one can not reasonably argue for
such alternatives.

Finally, there are other deeply embedded ellipses, which need to be resolved
as well:

\begin{enumerate}
  \item  In the part before the splitting conjunction \emph{'provided that'} we
  already had to expand the abridging \emph{'that work'} by its intended
  explicated version \emph{'that work containing portions of the Library'}.  In
  the part after the splitting conjunction the first subphrase also contains the
  term \emph{'the work'}. Formally, this term can either refer to \emph{'the
  work that uses the library'} as one of the components which are joined, or it
  can refer to \emph{'the work containing portions of the Library'} as the
  result of joining the components. We decide to constantly dissolve the
  elliptic abridgement by the phrase \emph{'the work containing portions of the
  Library'}.
  \item The first clause of the part after the splitting conjunction
  \emph{'provided that'} talks about the purpose of \enquote{permitting
  modification of the work} which we just had to unfold to the phrase
  \emph{'permitting modification of the work containing portions of the
  Library'}. The second clause talks about the purpose of \enquote{permitting
  reverse engineering}: it shall support the \enquote{debugging [of] such
  modifications}. The pronoun \emph{'such'} indicates that the word
  \emph{'modifications'} refers back to the just unfolded phrase
  \emph{modification of the work containing portions of the Library}. So, even
  the second sentence has to be expanded to that explicit phrase.
  \item Finally and only for being complete, we also have to unfold the clause
  \enquote{the terms} to the form which is predetermined by the first referred
  instance \enquote{the terms of your choice}
\end{enumerate}

So -- overall -- we are allowed to rewrite the first sentence of the LGPL-v2, §6
in the following form, namely without having changed its
meaning\footnote{Recollect that '*join' still stands for 'combine or link'.}:

\begin{verbatim}

( ( you may 
       *join a work that uses the Library with the Library
        to produce a work containing portions of the Library )
  AND 
  ( you may 
        distribute that work containing portions of the Library
        under terms of your choice 
) )
PROVIDED THAT
( ( the terms of your choice permit 
        modification of the work containing portions of 
        the Library for the customer's own use )
  AND
  ( the terms of your choice permit
        reverse engineering for debugging modifications 
        of the work containing portions of the Library   
) )
\end{verbatim}

At this point we must recommend all our readers to verify that this 'structured
explicated presentation' does exactly mean the same as the intially quoted
LGPL-v2-§6-sentence. We are now going to discuss some of its' logical aspects by
some formal transformations. For accepting our following operations and linking
the results back to the original LGPL-v2-§6-sentence, it is very helpful to know
that one already had to accept the equivalence of this explicated form and the
more condensed original version. For reviewing the equivalence the reader should
ask himself which of our rewritings are wrong, why they are wrong and which
alternatives can reasonably be offered for solving the syntactical issues which
disposed us to chose our solutions. Again, we ourselves -- of course -- are
profoundly convinced that both versions are completely equivalent.

\subsubsection{Logical Clarification}

For simplifying our discussion let us now replace the meaningful terminal
phrases of our form by some logical variables:

\begin{description}
  \item[$\Gamma$] :- (you may *join a work that uses the Library with the
  Library to produce a work containing portions of the Library) 
  \item[$\Delta$] :- (you may distribute that work containing portions of the
  Library under terms of your choice)
  \item[$\Phi$] :- (the terms of your choice permit modification of the work 
  containing portions of the Library for the customer's own use)
  \item[$\Sigma$] :- (the terms of your choice permit reverse engineering for
  debugging modifications of the work containing portions of the Library)
  \item[$\Theta$] :- \emph{$\Gamma$ and $\Delta$}
  \item[$\Omega$] :- \emph{$\Phi$ and $\Sigma$}
\end{description}

Based on these definitions, we can syntactically reduce our LGPL-v2-§6-sentence
to the formula \emph{$(\Gamma$ and $\Delta)$ provided that $(\Phi$ and
$\Sigma)$} or -- even shorter -- to \emph{$(\Theta$ provided that
$\Omega)$}.

Now, we have to clarify the meaning of the conjunction \emph{'provided that'}:

Obviously, \emph{provided that} means something like \emph{under the
precondition that}. So, one might try to take this conjunction as another more
stylish version of the more common \emph{if(\ldots)then(\ldots)}-formula, also
known as logical implication\footnote{Actually the logical implication and the
computational if-then-construct are not equivalent. Fortunately, we can later on
show, that in the context of this discussion the difference can be ignored.} But
there might also exist people who tend to say that -- beyond this traditional
interpretation -- the conjunction \emph{provided that} has also a temporal
dimension: \emph{$\Phi$ and $\Sigma$} must be realized, \textbf{before}
\emph{$\Gamma$ and $\Delta$} can happen.

Nevertheless, at first we have to consider the process of sequencing the
linguistic form into a logical formula: if we take the conjunction
\emph{provided that} as another form of the logical implication, it is not
obviously clear, which part of the  linguistic sentence must become the premise,
and which the conclusion. Does \emph{$\Theta$ provided that $\Omega$} mean
\emph{if $\Theta$ then $\Omega$} or \emph{if $\Omega$ then $\Theta$}?

Obviously, \emph{provided that} wants to establish something like a
precondition. So, one might conclude that \emph{$(\Theta$ provided that
$\Omega)$} means \emph{(if $\Omega$ then $\Theta)$} or -- more logically notated
-- \emph{$((\Phi$ $\wedge$ $\Sigma)$ $\rightarrow$ $(\Gamma$ $\wedge$
$\Delta))$}. If this interpretation is adequate, it of course must fulfill the
intended purpose of the corresponding LGPL-v2-section: there, the LGPL wants to
regulate the distribution of works containing portions of LGPL libraries.

For facilitating the understanding of our argumentation, let us first check
whether our interpretation fits the purpose of the LGPL. Thus let us unfold the
slightly reduced version \emph{$(\Sigma$ $\rightarrow$ $\Delta))$} back to the
corresponding verbal form:

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{\textbf{if (} [\ldots] the terms permit reverse
engineering for debugging modifications of the work containing portions of the
Library, \textbf{) then (} [\ldots] you may distribute that work containing
portions of the Library under the terms of your choice.\textbf{)}}\end{quote}

Now we can better see the problem: An implication as a whole is false only if
the premise is true and the conclusion is false. In all other cases it is true.
Especially, it is true, if the premise is false: in this case the truth value of
the conclusion does not matter in any sense. Thus, iIf we take this implication
as a rule, which shall determine our behaviour, then this implication only
supports us, if we already have decided to permit reverse engineering. In this
case the rule tells us that we are allowed to distribute the work containing
portions of the Library. But from the decision, that we will not permit reverse
engineering follows nothing - because a false premise does not influence the
truth value of the conclusion. Especially, it does not follow that we may not
distribute the work containing portions of the Library. So, from the viewpoint
of the formal logic this translation of the original conjunction \emph{'provided
that'} says, that if the terms of your own license do not permit reverse
engineering for debugging modifications of the work containing portions of the
Library\footnote{The premise is false.} then you may or may not distribute that
work containing portions of the Library under the terms of your
choice\footnote{The truth value of the conlusion is undetermined by the rule.}.
Hence, we must state that this interpretation does not fulfill the purpose of
the LGPL-V2: if reverse engineering is not allowed, the distribution of the work
containing portions of the Library is not regulated. We have to conclude, that
this sequencing the LGPL-v2-§6-sentence as a logical implication is simply
wrong.

But we deduced this consequence from a slighty reduced form of our
LGPL-v2-§6-sentence. Thus, we still have to ask, whether we have to derive this
conclusion also on the base of the completely unfolded formula \emph{$((\Phi$
$\wedge$ $\Sigma)$ $\rightarrow$ $(\Gamma$ $\wedge$ $\Delta))$}? The answer is
yes: the premise \emph{$((\Phi$ $\wedge$ $\Sigma)$} contains a logical
conjunction. So the truth value of the whole formula depends on the truth value
of on the terminal statement $\Sigma$: If we decide not to permit reverse
engineering, then the premise as whole is false, regardless we forbid or allow
modifications. And hence the premise does not influence the truth value of the
conclusion. So, there is no way, to conclude that have or do not have to allow
reverse engineering. Hence we can transfer our result, deduced for the slightly
reduced formula to the unfolded complete formula.

Let us now test the other possibility. Let us ask, whether \emph{$\Theta$
provided that $\Omega$} means \emph{if $\Theta$ then $\Omega$} or -- more
logically notated -- \emph{$((\Gamma$ $\wedge$ $\Delta)$ $\rightarrow$ $(\Phi$
$\wedge$ $\Sigma))$}. If we again for a moment focus on the reduced version
\emph{$(\Delta$ $\rightarrow$ $\Sigma)$} and dissolve our replacements, then we
get back the rule:

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{\textbf{if (} [\ldots] you may distribute that work
containing portions of the Library under the terms of your choice, \textbf{)
then (} [\ldots] the terms permit reverse engineering for debugging
modifications of the work containing portions of the Library.
\textbf{)}}\end{quote}

Now we can see, that this version perfectly regulates the distribution of works
containing portions of LGPL libraries: If we are allowed to do so or -- in other
words: if we are compliantly distributing works containing portions of LGPL
libraries\footnote{The premise is true.}, then we have to permit reverse
engineering\footnote{The conclusion must be true, too!}. This follows from
applying \emph{Modus Ponens} to the implication\footnote{A true premise evokes a
true conclusion based on the given truth of the implication / rule itself.}. And
if we do not permit reverse engineering\footnote{The conclusion is false.}, then
we are not allowed to distribute works containing portions of LGPL
libraries\footnote{The premise must be false, too!}. This follows from applying
\emph{Modus Tollens} to the implication\footnote{A false conclusion evokes a
false premise based on the given truth of the implication / rule itself.}

Based on this clarification, we can reasonably replace the more stylish
conjunction \emph{'provided that'} by its more known equivalent
\emph{'implication'} which we do not notate as traditional
\emph{if-then}-construction\footnote{Here we can also see, that the difference
between the if-then-command as part of a procedural computer language and the
logical implication does not influence our results: In the context of a
procedural if-then-command the truth of the premise triggers the execution of
the conclusion. In our discussion, this aspect is totally covered by the Modus
Ponens derivation of the logical interpretation. And the Modus Tollens
derivation of the logical interpretation on the other side does not play any
role in a procedural if-then-command. So, it was the right decision to
understand the LGPL-v2-§6-sentence logically and not as procedual command.}, but
as logical implication \emph{$\rightarrow$}. So, we now get

\begin{description}
  \item[\#] $\Theta$ $\rightarrow$ $\Omega$
  \item[$\equiv$] ($\Phi$ $\wedge$ $\Sigma$) $\rightarrow$ ($\Gamma$ $\wedge$
  $\Delta$)
  \item[$\equiv$]
\begin{alltt}   
  ( ( [\(\Phi\)] you may 
       *join a work that uses the Library with the Library
       to produce a work containing portions of the Library )
  \(\wedge\)
  ( [\(\Sigma\)] you may 
        distribute that work containing portions of the 
        Library under terms of your choice 
) )
\(\rightarrow\)
( ( [\(\Gamma\)] the terms of your choice permit 
        modification of the work containing portions of 
        the Library for the customer's own use )
  \(\wedge\)
  ( [\(\Delta\)] the terms of your choice permit
        reverse engineering for debugging modifications 
        of the work containing portions of the Library   
) )
\end{alltt}
\end{description}

\subsubsection{Empirical Clarification}

Now, we can simplify this formula once more by regarding some empirical facts:

First, we should explicate an underlying empirically based understanding of
$\Phi$ which enables us to link $\Phi$ and $\Sigma$ in better way:

$\Phi$ explains that the \emph{work that uses the Library} and the used
\emph{Library} itself together are joined and thereby tansformed into a
\emph{work containing portions of the Library}. So, formally, one might ask,
whether this newly generated \emph{work containing portions of the Library} also
still \emph{uses the Library}?

Unfortunately, it is empirically possible, that a process for combining the two
components (a) copies all original portions of the library into a something like
a 'dead end section' of the program where they are never excuted, and (b)
replaces all original portions of the library by functionally equivalent
portions of another library. Thus, the resulting \emph{work containing portions
of the Library} indeed still contains portions of the Library, although it does
not use it any longer. And hence, we are not allowed to say, that generally
every work containing portions of a library also uses the
library\footnote{\ldots even if we think that this is a really silly way to
organize the joining process!}.

But, fortunately, the normal computational process of \emph{combining and
linking a work that uses the Library with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library} inherently preserves the utilization of the
joined library: It is the general purpose of a software library to offer
functions and/or data (structures) for really being used by applications. And
vice versa, software developers want to use readily prepared libraries (or
classes or anything else) for simplifying their own work. They chose a library
because they know, that the standard compiling and linking process guarantees,
that indeed the chosen library is used (and not secretly substituted by a
mysterious 'equivalent'). Based on this empirical praxis we are therefore
allowed to say that a \emph{work containing portions of the Library}
which has been built by the normal processes of combining, compiling, and
linking source and object files, indeed also uses the intended library.

Based on this clarification we can now simplify the formula presented above:

If we are allowed to do $\Sigma$, in other words: if we are allowed to
\emph{distribute that work containing portions of the Library under terms of
your choice} and if we really do so, then we must already have done $\Phi$, in
other words: we must already have \emph{*joined -- respectively: combined or
linked -- a work that uses the Library with the Library to produce a work
containing portions of the Library}.

So, obviously, the $\Sigma$ empirically implies $\Phi$\footnote{but not vice
versa.}. But is that correct? Let us check this statement by assuming the
opposite: If the contrary is true, then there must exist a \emph{work containing
portions of the Library} which has been gained from the library without that both
components have been linked or combined. To talk about a \emph{work containing
portions of the Library} and also to state, that this work is not combined with
the library in any sense, is indeed self-contradictory: based on the meaning of
\emph{being combined with} it seems empirically unpossible that a work literally
contains more or less parts of a library and at the same time is not combined
with the library.

And because we also have already determined that -- in the normal world of
software development -- a \emph{work containing portions of the Library} also
\emph{uses the Library}, we can now conclude that $\Sigma$ empirically implies
$\Phi$ (in the normal world of software development). Thus, we can reduce
the LGPL-v2-§6-sentence to its' real core:

\begin{quote}
\begin{alltt}   
(   [\(\Sigma\)] you may 
        distribute that work containing portions of the 
        Library\(\footnote{which uses the library}\) under terms of your choice 
) 
\(\rightarrow\)
( ( [\(\Gamma\)] the terms of your choice permit 
        modification of the work containing portions of 
        the Library for the customer's own use )
  \(\wedge\)
  ( [\(\Delta\)] the terms of your choice permit
        reverse engineering for debugging modifications 
        of the work containing portions of the Library   
) )
\end{alltt}
\end{quote}

This is indeed the essence of the LGPL-v2-§6-sentence. It logically explain us
that we have to \emph{allow reverse engineering} and modification of a
\emph{work containing portions of the Library} if we distribute it (Modus
Ponens) and that we are \emph{not allowed to distribute a work containing portions of
the Library}, if we do \emph{not allow} its modification or \emph{reverse
engineering} (Modus Tollens).

Thus, for applying this rule correctly, one only must know whether the work
contains portions of the Library or not.

\subsubsection{Final Conclusion}

Unfortunately, there are more than one environments for developing
software, which all must be considered, if we want to answer this question in
detail. We see three general types of developing computer software:

You can produce software by using script languages. Such a source file is
directly executed by an interpreter. Or you can develop software by using
languages which are designed for being compiled into a machine independent
bytecode. Later on this independent bytecode is executed by a machine specific
virtual machine. Or one can write traditional software files. Such source files
can directly be compiled and linked down to machine specific binary code. Or
they can previously be remastered by a preprocessor. Either these traditional
sources or the output of the preprocessor finally is compiled and linked down to
machine specific binary code. 'php' is an example for the first environment,
'Java' an example for the second, and 'C/C++' an example for the third.

But fortunately, the nature of these environments simplifies to answer the
question under which conditions the work using the Library contains portions of
the Library:

In all the three environments of software development we dscribed, the work
which uses the Library is joined to the intended Library by an include
statement, an input statement, an import statement, a package statement, or
anything else. These *join-statements are inserted into the code of the work and
directly or indirectly denote the file which serves the used functions, methods,
classes, or data. But inserting such a *join-statement into the work using the
library does not directly augments the code of the work by some code of the
Library: the development processes are designed to offer an automatical
expansion during the standard compilation or execution. Nevertheless, developers
can circumvent these standard methods for using a Library. They can directly
copy code of the Library into their own work. Together with the work, these
manually evoked extensions of the code will later on directly be compiled or
executed. Thus, it is clear, that in this case the work that uses the Library
already contains portions of the Library, namely before the normal
*join-processes of the environment have been executed. Fortunately, the LGPL-v2
directly regulates this kind of using the Library. It says, that \enquote{you
may modify your copy or copies of the Library or any portion of it [\ldots]
provided that you also [\ldots] cause the whole of the work to be licensed
[\ldots]] under the terms of this License}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.,§2,
escpcially §2c]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}.
So, in case of literally copying code from the Library into the work using the
Library there is no need to additionally permit its reverse engineering, because
the code itself has also to be made accessible.

Let us secondly consider the case of script programming. Computer programs
written in a script language are distributed as they have been developed. They are not
transformed into another kind of code\footnote{Java script is often offered as
compressed code. Roughly spoken, this means that at first all white space signs
have been replaced by blanks and then all rows of blanks have been reduced to at
most one single blank. So, even then, the code itself is directly readable and
understandable.}. The interpreter takes the script file itself and directly
executes it. Thus, there is no special technique of reverse engineering for
understanding these kind of software: you can directly read it if you know the
script language. Hence, this type of software is also not covered by a rule
which requires to permit reverse engineering.

Now, let us analyse the case of languages which are compiled down to machine
independent byte code. Let us discuss Java as the prototype of this way to
generate software. In Java, each class is compiled to an own class file. These
class files have to be stored somewhere in the classpath. A side from that,
classes can be collected and distributed as packages which then can be used as
Libraries. These packages must also be stored somewhere in the classpath. A
single class is made known to the work that want to use it, by an import
statement which contains the Class name. A whole Java library is made usable by
integrating a package statement into the code. The code of the work using the
Libarary which follows the import statement or the package declaration can then
refer to the definitions offered by the classes by using the (qualified) names
of its member variables or methods. So, from a strict viewpoint, the code of the
work using the Libarary indeed contains portions of the library -- even if these
portions are only identifying names. But during the java compilation
process these referring elements are still not replaced by the denoted elements
of the Library itself. Only just at the end, when the java virtual machine tries
to execute the work using the Library, it collects all necessary commands of all
'joined' classes.

So, one might tend to argue that answering the question whether a distributed
java byte code already contains portions of the used Library, depends on the
interpretation, whether a denoting identifier of a Library indeed is a portion
of the Library. We will discuss this case together with the corresponding
c/c++-Case. 

But there is one specific Java case which has to be analysed separately. After
having done all your development work, you may join your work that uses the
Library (by having used all these denoting indentifiers) and the Library itself
by building a new package which then contains your work using the Library and
the used Library itself. One can say, that the package is quasi statically
linked, because if you distribute it, then you are distributing both parts
together. And if you distribute a work (package) containing portions of the
Library, you have to permit reverse engineering.

So, our interim conclusion is this: If you distribute your work using the
Library and the Library itself as (statically linked) package, then you have to
permit reverse engineering. But if you distribute your own work using the
Library as a set of your own classes, then your obligation depends on the
interpretation whether identifying names of a Library are indeed portions of it.
We will decide this issue soon.

Now, let us analyse the case of languages which are compiled down to machine
specific code. Let us discuss C/C++ as the prototype of this way to generate
software. Similar to Java, in C/C++ code a Library is made be known to the using
work by the include statements which denote the header files of the Library.
These header files contain the declaration of those elements which the Library
want to announce. Except some cases, the definitions of those elements (the code
itself) are delivered by the Library file, not by its header files. Based on a
make-file which knows all the places where the compiled files and
libraries are stored, the process of c/c++-development finally compiles the work
using the library down to an object file containing machine specific code. An it
generates a link script by which the linker of the system is able to link the
Library and the work using the Library as an executable program.

This additional link-command can be executed just during the normal development
process --- before the work is distributed. In this case, the work using the
Library and the Library itself are statically linked to one file containing all
machine specific code. So, if you distribute a statically linked work, the it
definitely contains portions of the library\footnote{Normally, a linker greps
only those elements out of the Library which indeed are used by the work.}. Or
the link command can be executed after having distributed the result, on a
seperate machine. Mostly, this is done automatically and directly, before the
work using the Library shall be executed. This kind of linking the interim
objects files and libraries on the machine which executes the work is known as
dynamic linking. It is dynamical because one can change the Library just before
the execution even if the work using the Library has been developed against an
earlier, better, other version of it.

So, we \textbf{can} again \textbf{conclude} that you have to permit reverse
engineering if you distribute a statically linked program. And we
\textbf{could conclude} that your obligation to allow reverse engine depends on
the interpretation whether identifying names of a Library are indeed portions of
it if you distribute a dynamically linked program.

Unfortunately, there is a little complication based on the nature of the a C/C++
development process. In contrary to the Java development environment, a C/C++
development process inherently uses a preprocessor engine. This engine takes the
header files delivered by the Library, verifies the syntactically correct use of
the Library and can indeed replaces some tokens of the work using the Library by
sourcecode from the Library. These snippets which replaces strings in the source
code of the work using the library are known as inline functions. They have been
invented for those cases where the expanding the stack of commands by a real
function is more expensive than writing the comands of the function more than
one time into the whole code. But -- of course -- there is no technical limit. A
header file could also contain more than only some lines of the Library code.
Nevertheless, in this case the work which uses the Library does not only
contains names denoting the elements of the Library, but it also contain real
portions of the Library. 

So, we now have to expand our interim conclusion for the c/c++ Case: You have to
permit reverse engineering if you distribute a statically linked program. And 
if you distribute a dynamically linked programs your obligation to allow reverse
engine depends (a) on the interpretation whether identifying names of a Library
are indeed portions of it and (b) if the header files contain inline functions.

Altogether, just on this point, the rule of the LGPL-v2 which wants to regulate
the distribution of a work which already contains portions of the used Library
does not work as well as one wishes. But fortunately, the LGPL-v2 supports us
for simplifying these constraints:

The LGPL simply specifies that \enquote{linking a \enquote{work that uses the
Library} with the Library creates an executable that is a derivative of the
Library (because it contains portions of the Library) [\ldots]} and that
\enquote{the executable is therefore covered by this
License}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp. §5]{Lgpl21OsiLicense199a}. But an
\enquote{object file} -- for example of the \enquote{work using the Library} --
which still is not linked with the Library and which \enquote{[\ldots] uses only
numerical parameters, data structure layouts and accessors, and small macros and
small inline functions (ten lines or less in length)} is pratically not covered
by the license of the Library because \enquote{[\ldots] the use of the object
file is unrestricted regardless of whether it is legally a derivative
work}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp. §5]{Lgpl21OsiLicense199a}.

Now, we reached our target: this interpretation can directly be applied to both
open cases, to the case of distributing Java byte code which only contains
referring identifiers and to the case of distribution C/C++ object code. And
fortunately the limits given by the LGPL-v2-§5 totally covers the normal use of
C/C++ and Java libraries.

So we indeed finally may conclude that the LGPL-v2-§6 sentence

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{\enquote{[\ldots] you may [\ldots] combine
\textbf{or} link a \enquote{work that uses the Library} with the Library to
produce a work containing portions of the Library \textbf{and} distribute that
work under terms of your choice, \textbf{provided that} the terms permit
modification of the work for the customer's own use \textbf{and} \emph{reverse
engineering} for debugging such modifications.}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp.
emphasis KR.]{Lgpl21OsiLicense1999a}}
\end{quote}

means 'nothing more' than

\begin{quote}\noindent\emph{
\begin{itemize}
  \item You must allow reverse engineering of a work using a Library if you
  distribute both parts together as a statically linked program or collected
  package.
  \item You are not required to allow reverse engineering if you distribute one
  or both parts in a form that they are dynamically linked on the machine which
  executes the work using the Library\footnote{This means also that it has been
  compiled down by the normal development processes and it therefore contain
  only the normal identifier}.
  \item In all other cases, you are required to allow reverse engineering of a
  work using a Library.
\end{itemize}
}
\end{quote}

\subsubsection{Final Securing}

We have done a lot of work: At first we unfolded and dissolved stylisch
condensed formulations used in the original LGPL-v2-§6 sentence back to their
linguistically explicit form. At second we explicated the logical structure of
the sentence. At third we empirically carved out the real meaning of the
sentence. And finally we mapped the triggering part of that rule to a definitive
fact. Indeed, a lot of work for only one sentence.

So, it is a good step to verify that deduced result fits the spirit and the
goals of the LGPL-v2 perfectly.


\subsection{Reverse Engineering in the LGPL-v3}

Now we can shorten the way to understand the meaning of the LGPL-v3 concerning
\emph{reverse enigeering}. Also the LGPL-v3.0 contains only one paragraph
explicitly referring the \emph{reverse enigeering}:


\begin{quote}\emph{
\enquote{You may convey a Combined Work under terms of your choice that,
taken together, effectively \emph{do not restrict} modification of the portions
of the Library contained in the Combined Work and \emph{reverse engineering} for
debugging such modifications, if you also do each of the following
[\ldots]}\footcite[cf.][\nopage wp]{Lgpl30OsiLicense2007a}}
\end{quote}
