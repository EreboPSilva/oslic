this is the branch master: a file signalling where we are working

remember: for using git with https (write access) with proxy
you have to 
(1) made known the used proxy to git by executing the command
git config --global http.proxy $YOUR_HTTP_PROXY:$YOUR_PROXY_PORT
(2) cloning the repository using the command
git clone https://dtag-dbu@github.com/dtag-dbu/oslic.git

While cloning (pulling, fetching, pushing) anything you then
will be asked for the password of the github-user dtag-dbu
