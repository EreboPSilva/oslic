1 Introduction
1.1 Why
Is there a need for another book about Open Source Software?  Let us address this question from the viewpoint of what we already know, what we instinctively believe and what we may have heard. Understanding this basis you may presume one or more of the following statements is correct or you may even have experienced similar perceptions from your peers or managers:

• The Open Source Definition offers rules to use Open Source Software.
• Modified Open Source Software must be published.
• Modified Open Source Software must be given back to the community.
• Future generations of published Open Source Software will remain open for ever.
• Software can either be Open Source Software or proprietary software.
• The opposite of Open Source Software is commercial software.
• Open Source Software prevents anybody earning money from distribution.
• Modifications of Open Source Software must be clearly marked.
• Modifiers must identify themselves and mark their changes.
• When distributing an Open Source binary it’s enough point to a download page to obtain the source code.
• An aim of Open Source Software is to improve the world ethically.
• Open Source Software is always viral.

Do these misconceptions sound familiar to you? Because they are all surely incorrect.

Writing from the perspective of a large German company we most certainly do need another Open Source software book, not only to identify the common misconceptions, but to cater for the unique needs of a large Enterprise. The very size of the company brings its own problems in this case, the large number of diverse Open Source deployments in different contexts mean that case by case governance, a model that may work in small concerns is far from appropriate for our needs. It will lead to wasting of both time and money will stand only a small chance of success.
